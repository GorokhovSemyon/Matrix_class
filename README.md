# Matrix_class
## About
- This class represents the implementation of the SLOUGH solution by Gauss method with selection of the main element by lines
- Allows to find inverse matrices to the original square ones
- Matrices of size n x n are supported
## Available methods
- finding the resulting solution vector by Gauss method
- checking the degeneracy of the matrix
- overloading operators [], *, ==
- finding the inverse matrix
